## Overview
MedLink tackles pressing healthcare challenges such as inadequate doctor-patient ratios, delayed diagnoses, and limited access to healthcare schemes. The platform connects hospitals through a network that facilitates:
- Centralized patient data management
- Real-time resource tracking
- AI-powered data retrieval and diagnostics
- Enhanced support for maternal and child health in rural areas

## Problem Statement
Healthcare systems are burdened by:
- **Resource Constraints:** Severe shortages in medical staff and equipment, especially in rural areas.
- **Delayed Diagnoses:** Inefficient data access contributes to critical delays in patient care.
- **Low Scheme Awareness:** Limited enrollment in healthcare insurance and government schemes due to complex processes.
- **Maternal and Child Health Challenges:** Under-nutrition and delayed identification of high-risk pregnancies affecting vulnerable populations.

## Solution Overview
MedLink provides a holistic approach by integrating:
- **Universal Patient Database:** A secure, centralized repository of patient records.
- **AI-Powered Chatbot:** Immediate, accurate data retrieval and decision support powered by models like Llama 3.
- **Resource Management:** Real-time tracking and updates of hospital resources to optimize capacity.
- **Inter-Hospital Collaboration:** Automated alerts and notifications to enable resource sharing during shortages.
- **Dedicated Maternal/Child Health Module:** Special features to assist frontline workers (e.g., ASHA) in high-risk pregnancy detection, dietary advice, and scheme mapping.
- **Offline Capabilities:** Local caching to ensure functionality in areas with limited connectivity.

## Key Features
- **Resource Management:** Monitor hospital assets (beds, equipment, ventilators) in real time.
- **Universal Patient Database:** Secure storage and easy access to patient histories.
- **AI Chatbot:** Rapid query resolution to support doctors in diagnostic and treatment processes.
- **Inter-Hospital Alerts:** Automated notifications for resource sharing during emergencies.
- **Maternal/Child Health Module:** Targeted support for frontline workers to improve maternal and child health outcomes.
- **Scheme Mapping:** Automated eligibility checks and enrollment support for healthcare schemes.
- **Offline Access:** Ensures continuous functionality in low-connectivity environments.

## Architecture
MedLink utilizes a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and flexibility:
- **Resource Service:** Tracks hospital resources and updates availability in real time.
- **Patient Data Service:** Manages secure access to patient records.
- **AI Service:** Powers the chatbot and diagnostic features using open-source AI models.
- **Collaboration Service:** Facilitates inter-hospital resource sharing with real-time alerts.
- **Maternal/Child Service:** Provides specialized analytics and guidance for maternal and child health.
- **Scheme Service:** Automates the mapping of patient profiles to appropriate healthcare schemes.

Services communicate via RESTful APIs. The front-end is built using Next.js/Typescript, while the back-end leverages Python for analytics and machine learning tasks. Cloud deployment and offline support are integrated to ensure the system is robust and adaptable to various environments.

## Technology Stack
- **Front-End:** Next.js, Typescript
- **Back-End:** Python (Analytics, Machine Learning)
- **Database:** MongoDB with Prisma ORM
- **AI Models:** Llama 3 (with potential alternatives like Gemini)
- **Architecture:** Microservices communicating via RESTful APIs
- **Data Sources:** Public datasets (e.g., MIMIC-III), PubMed, and synthetic data for testing

## Project Process
MedLink was conceptualized for the Pragati AI for Impact Hackathon 2025 by Team **QUBITRULES** (Team Leader: Zaid Ahmad). The initial project process involves:
1. **Idea Submission & Validation:** Aligning the project with hackathon themes and defining clear objectives.
2. **System Design & Architecture:** Establishing a scalable microservices framework and defining key roles (Super Admin, Hospital Admin, Doctors, etc.).
3. **Prototype Development:** Building core components such as the universal patient database and AI-powered chatbot.
4. **Testing & Feedback:** Validating functionalities with public datasets (MIMIC-III) and synthetic data.
5. **Iterative Enhancements:** Expanding features based on pilot testingâ€”such as the maternal/child health module and offline capabilities.

## Installation and Setup
To set up MedLink locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MedLink.git
   cd MedLink
